Question Generation is important in AI if it is from an AI agent. This is because it shows a sense of curiosity and ensures that an AI agent is following a conceptual flow while maintaining contextual interaction with the user. 

Better things can happen with such a method:
* Workflow-driven language Modeling
* Minimize generation which has no trace to factual information ( A work in progress)

Excited about my first and upcoming Patent with Samsung Research America on [â€œDynamic question generation for information-gathering"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230061906A1/en).
