Dear Colleagues and Students,

We are organizing the 3rd International Workshop on Knowledge-infused Learning in conjunction with KDD 2023.  

Link: https://aiisc.ai/kiml2023

This year we are having a special theme session on **NeuroSymbolic AI**. We invite contributions along novel methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics. 

# Important Dates:

* Paper submission deadline: May 23, 2023 (_possible extension because of delayed decision from KDD_)

* Author notification: June 23, 2023

* Camera-ready: June 27, 2023

* Workshop Date: August 6-10, 2023
