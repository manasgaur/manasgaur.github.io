Started as an [Assistant Professor](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/manas-gaur/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/) at [The University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/). 
* Fortunate to recieve unrestricted gift from [RAAPID](https://www.raapid.ai/) for research on Conversational Systems. 
* Current Research Directions:
    * Personalized Dialog Systems in Mental Healthcare
    * [Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08660.pdf)
    * [Knowledge-infused Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00512.pdf)
    * [Knowledge Graphs](https://aiisc.ai/xaikg/)
* For __UMBC Students__: I am actively looking students for Directed Study or Independent Study at UMBC.  
* For __External Students__: I would be able to support you after we have accomplished atleast __3 months__ in collaborative research. 

* Do learn about __excited projects__ in [CSEE @ UMBC](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/)

* Excited to share that following tutorials will be delivered in [ICON 2022](https://www.lcs2.in/ICON-2022/) and [AI/ML Systems](https://www.aimlsystems.org/2022/) Conferences. 
    * Neuro-symbolic AI for Mental Health at [AI/ML Systems 2022](https://www.aimlsystems.org/2022/accepted_tutorial_list)
    * Process Knowledge-infused Reinforcement Learning at [ICON 2022](https://lcs2.in/ICON-2022/workshops.html)
