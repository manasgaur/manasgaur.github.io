I am an assistant professor of <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://umbc.edu/">University of Maryland Baltimore County</a>. In the past, I have hold the position of Senior AI Research Scientist with the Knowledge and Dialog team within <a href="https://research.samsung.com/artificial-intelligence">AI Center</a> at Samsung Research America. I was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">the Alan Turing Institute</a>. I have been awarded PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="http://aiisc.ai">Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> at  <a href="https://sc.edu/">The University of South Carolina</a> in 2022, where I was advised by <a href="http://amit.aiisc.ai/">Dr. Amit Sheth</a>. Prior to this, I completed bachelors and masters in Computer Science and Software Engineering from <a href="http://aiactr.ac.in/">Netaji Subhas University of Technology</a>(East Campus) and <a href="http://www.dtu.ac.in/">Delhi Technological University</a>, India, respectively.   

<p style="font-family:sans-serif;"> &#128680;At UMBC CSEE, I will be starting a reading+research group: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VJ8ZdCEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Knowledge-infused AI and Inference</a>(<b style="font-family:verdana;"> KAI<sup>2</sup></b>)(<i>website Coming Soon</i>). Please drop me an email if you would like join!!</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><b>Research Interests</b></h2>
I have broad interests in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357868">knowledge</a> graphs and machine learning (in particular deep learning) for application into natural language processing, recommender systems, and computational social data science. My research is mostly directed towards:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970629">Knowledge-infused Learning</a>: is a class of Neuro-Symbolic AI techniques that utilize a variety of knowledge (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3269206.3271732">lexical</a>, linguistic, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250448">domain specific</a>, <a href="https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-10689.GaurM.pdf">commonsense</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13884.pdf"> process knowledge</a> and constraint-based) in different forms and abstractions into <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2600/paper14.pdf">deep neural network</a>. It improves upon data-centric statistical learning to reduce training, reduce computing needs, and broaden coverage, resulting in improved performance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12560.pdf">safety</a> and model interpretation, and providing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpuhqjKNnDg&t=3352s">user-level explanations</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514440">Knowledge Intensive Language Understanding:</a>  is a new unified benchmark to help AI researchers build models that are better able to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08145">leverage real-world knowledge</a> to accomplish a broad range of tasks. Models that are better able to leverage real-world knowledge do well in tasks o</li>
</ul>
I recently gave a tutorial on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/aiisc/finalkgckirltutorial2022aiinstitutepptx">Knowledge-infused Reinforcement Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/kgc-2022-tutorial-knowledge-infused-reinforcement-learning/">Knowledge Graph Conference</a>, which is one of core AI areas I am interested in. I am fascinated about interdisciplinary research as it provide practical means to make real world impact. I collaborate with domain experts in mental health, crisis informatics, conversational AI, virtual health assistant, and digital security. I also have been a co-organizer and a strong proponent of two communities: <a href="https://aiisc.ai/KiL2021/">Knowledge-infused Mining and Learning</a> and <a href="https://clpsych.org/">Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology</a>.
